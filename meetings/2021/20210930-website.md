# üìù Notes

- Events bot should be on a weekly schedule now.
- Narb has been added as a maintainer and Dhaiwat has been added as a triage team member
- For translations: machine learning awkward-grammar can be really offputting
  - make a dashboard for translation missing keys in the site's repo
    - look to PRs even to track what those things might be
    - eslint plugin?
- Address the redesign work by @marbiano
  - talk of setting up a pair (stream?) @with-heart and lots of people to do a chakra-ui work
  - @with-heart wants to mob program as 1) proof of concept and 2) to maybe do stuff (and probably coordinate with dhaiwat)
  - ensure that we have the intended/desired information about the value of the joining/minting
  - Add in an explicit section to address people that may not have the resources to mint (aka sponsorship)
  - Can (when we jump off to the minting section) check if the person has a wallet
    - if they have a wallet, you probably have basic understanding of what you're doing and we can present sales + mint
    - if they don't have a wallet, you probably need some walkthrough
  - Should clarify what you get when you join discord without minting
    - right now you get a pretty empty shell of a discord and not much to clarify why you don't see very much
- We should curate a twitter campaign when we relaunch the page (update it with a new design)
- Generate content around "how to use the tools we're using"
  - helps us (as contributors) understand how to use things as we (as an organization) add them to the site
  - also should be documenting in/with the PRs
  - Loom has come up as a tool
- We can build our own theme package to support our Chakra-UI look and feel across multiple projects
  - Can do the same with components if we need to
- On development guidelines draft PR / document
  - Keep it in the project but don't reference it on the website directly
  - @narb has updated to be more friendly
  - push to finalize some portion of it and get it out there (in the repo)
