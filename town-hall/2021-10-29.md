## Knowledge Base

- `nathang.eth` gives update
    - Two use cases
        - Notion - DAO Wiki
            - Internal tool, creating structure to it to solicit contributions from users on content and design
        - [Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrqw4chX4AuTCdf3/tbljejdzelezqT0W7) - Gathering Resources to share within our community, organizing so members and public can get a better understanding of DevDAO
            - Will host the resources database, `kempsterrrr` leading the charge on this
            - sync to airtable with markdown
- Discord bot
    - create bot to use / command to add resources to databases `NoahH`
- We have seen an uptick in contributions!

## D_D Merch

- Merch was mentioned in chat this last town hall. Potentially something for designers in the DAO to drum up some ideas. A `#merch` channel was created after last town hall.
- [MetaFactory](https://www.metafactory.ai/) has been mentioned as an on-chain provider of merch

## Notes

- How should we Contribute? What projects are working? What projects are down the pipeline?
