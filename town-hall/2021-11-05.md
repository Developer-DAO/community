        - Allows us to validate data, rather than Airtable

## Season 0 Proposal

- Season 0 proposal is out [on Discourse](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p3-developer-dao-season-0/219/18)
- Assuming vote is in favor on Sunday, it will be moved to a [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth)
- Engagement was around 1/4, other DAOs are usually just a few percent
- [Boardroom](https://www.boardroom.info/) may be used in the future to centralize our decentralization
- Three Guilds to be formed in coming weeks
    - Community Guild
    - Development Guild
    - Design Guild
    - Marketing/BizDev Guild
    - Editorial Guild
    - Governance Guild
- Announcement post on Mirror next weekend introducing Developer DAO and Season 0
  - Snapshot vote for Season 0 Proposal runs until next town hall @ 5pm UTC. If it passes, Season 0 begins
- We are looking to build an inclusive community, message `nader` if you know anyone who needs help with minting or have any ideas
    - Roadmap for different guilds could help break down barriers for anyone new to the development world
    - Potentially could have Docents to help welcome people to the community
- [If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together...](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/if-you-want-to-go-fast-go-alone-if-you-want-to-go-far-go-together-if-you-want-to-go-nowhere-start-a-dao/122?u=nathanng.eth)
- We're looking into options for season tokens on L2s/Solana

## GitCoin Partnership

- [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co) was one of the first public resources to learn and earn on-chain revenue by building in the Web3 space
    - Also are funding projects in the Web3 space
    - There is potential for Gitcoin to dedicate funds to our DAO
    - Enough to fund our treasury for a while and compensate contribution
    - We will do an announcement when this is finalized
- One of their projects is the [MoonshotCollective](https://moonshotcollective.space/)
- 2-3 weeks on an optimistic time-scale

# Notes

- Grants
    - $200MM grant with Avalanche
        - we can apply as a DAO
    - $1BB Algorand just [announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSDCFP903m8)
- [Kernel](http://kernel.community/en/) has a learning track path where you'll lock up 400 DAI
- Are we considering Polygon for the pixel avatars/future tokens?
    - We can do a vote on this!
- Now is a good time for us to begin to flesh out guidelines, reporting mechanisms, etc.
    - we could look into to have cohort-style onboarding in future
    - Learning path tokens
- Q&A at the end
  - Discussed the onboarding is currently very confusion and needs to be improved
    - Key gaol for Community Guild during Season 0
  - Discussed the whilst we speak about inclusivity and diversity, this is currently lacking in the Core Team who are on stage speaking for the DAO.
    - Suggested we open up a space for discussing this further to get feedback from everyone in the community on how we can improve here.
- Discussed the exclusive nature of having to pay gas fees for the NFT
  - Acknowledge that this isn't ideal. Need someone way to gate membership, when launched gas fee's were not as high as they are now so wasn't as big a barrier. Doesn't change the fact that some people wont be able to afford, was best option at the time.
  - Some effort has been made by `Nader` and others to other membership to people who otherwise cannot afford their won via give aways but we could do a lot.
  - In the future when we could consider sponsorships, bounties, more NFTs on layer 2's for access.
