        - looking to add to the Discord
        - `NoahH` the goal is to make adding contributions to the database easier
        - Allows us to validate data, rather than Airtable
        - Will allow us to add resources from any channel

## Season 0 Proposal

- Season 0 proposal is out [on Discourse](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p3-developer-dao-season-0/219/18)
- Assuming vote is in favor on Sunday, it will be moved to a [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth)
- Engagement was around 1/4, other DAOs are usually just a few percent
- [Boardroom](https://www.boardroom.info/) may be used in the future to centralize our decentralization
- Three Guilds to be formed in coming weeks
    - Community Guild
    - Development Guild
    - Design/Marketing/BizDev Guild
- Announcement post on Mirror next weekend
    - after 5pm UTC next Friday - keep in mind daylight savings times
- We are looking to build an inclusive community, message `nader` if you know anyone who needs help with minting or have any ideas
    - Roadmap for different guilds could help break down barriers for anyone new to the development world
    - Potentially could have Docents to help welcome people to the community
- [If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together...](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/if-you-want-to-go-fast-go-alone-if-you-want-to-go-far-go-together-if-you-want-to-go-nowhere-start-a-dao/122?u=nathanng.eth)
- We're looking into options for season tokens on L2s/Solana

## GitCoin Partnership

- [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co) was one of the first public resources to learn and earn on-chain revenue by building in the Web3 space
    - Also are funding projects in the Web3 space
    - There is potential for Gitcoin to dedicate funds to our DAO
    - Enough to fund our treasury for a while and compensate contribution
    - We will do an announcement when this is finalized
- One of their projects is the [MoonshotCollective](https://moonshotcollective.space/)
- 2-3 weeks on an optimistic time-scale
