# ⏱ Agenda

## Introduction

- Welcome
- Update on DAO stats
  - Holders & total mint
  - Discord

## Action items review

- ✅`kempster` find solution for audio recording, ideally automated via a Bot
- ✅ `kempster` estbalish server channel for defining dao mission statement/dao
  manifesto. `Nader` happy to be a driver for this.
- 🗣 `Nader` to continue conversation with SeedClub to understand: a) how they
  can help, b) any other advice they have at this stage.
- ✅ `~~codingwithmanny~~` `kemspterrrr` to test deploying discouse to DO and
  AWS, make decision as to best option
- ﹖ `kempster` to share example proposal frameworks to use in discourse
- `Nader` share access to social channels

## Project Updates

What's happening, what's next, how can people get involved and any specific
support needed:

- Website `@with-heart`
- Derivatives TBC hopefully `@goldzulu`
- Discourse `@kempsterrrr`
- Knowledge base - `@N8tion`

## Mirror.xyz / $WRITE reace

TBC but hopefully `@marc` giving some info on mirror and $WRITE race

## DAO Canvas, roadmap & manifesto

`@nader` unfortunately can't make it, `@kempsterrr` to give a quick update

## Anything else?

## 📝 Notes

Discourse is now live! (thanks @kempsterrrr.eth)
- could use a proposal framework (inertia is towards Bankless, but if anyone else knows a good one then we could use that)

Website update from `@with-heart`
- how to contribute
- new landing page PR / work in progress

Pixel Avatar update from `@goldzulu`
- eknobl doing a lot of the art
- traits are all drawn up except clothing/language/industry
- frontend viewer has been added to the repo (rasmussen (sp?)) 
- they're working on mint-based-upon-token functionality
- `@etherinside.eth` is leading on the contract work
- more to see in/around the derivatives channel
- quick demo by `@goldzulu` of the testing app

Knowledge Base (`@nathanng.eth`)
- project based on the goal of learning / continual and onboarding learning
- plan is to iterate, right now a markdown list of content
- future is expected to get more complex with conceptual grouping, etc

Mirror.xyz (`@marc`)
- want to get DeveloperDAO on the platform:
  - place to host content
  - ways to monetize content
- have to win the write race to get on
- planning to enter the write race as a community on Wednesday
  - need to have community turn out to vote for it
- revenues would go to the community treasury (dispensation for creator would have to be a separate thing internal to the DAO)
- we will need to have content generation team lined up

Manifesto workup (`@kempsterrrr`)
- bit of centralization to ensure that we can drive it through
- intent to create seasons and quickly call ourselves season 0
  - foundational season in which we'd finish figuring our operations, etc
  - gets us moving so that we have momentum and keep doing stuff
- putting stuff on the Discourse could be good for Manifesto content
  - with as much context as possible, put up your ideas in the general board
  - proposals should be more constrained
- ties to the use of Discourse and getting some semblance of governance with discord -> discourse (topics) -> discourse (proposals) -> action

Tech and managerial debt avoidance has been an operational choice. We, on the other hand, are/should be documenting what we pick and why. Hopefully we are going to be able to build things that others may use - but we shouldn't avoid perfectly good solutions just because we could build an alternative

Have to try to drive people to capture discord chats on Discourse
On Discourse, it would be great to cite sources that drove the conversation
- drives conversation and helps others catch up if they're viewing it later
Goal: Self documenting DAO
- could be picked apart and made clear, but shoot for the concept in the meantime

update from `nader` on seedclub and gitcoin conversation:
- getting more info together and assembling more DAO infra before really going back to talk with seedclub more
- gitcoin steered the conversation towards working with DevDAO (a nice turn on their part)
`Nader` to get a body from gitcoin and/or seedclub to talk to the DAO directly
Mission statement and big picture content being polished will make for the best platform for `Nader`

cadence and timing: pick out alternating date/times between weeks to handle people having different timezones

how do we feel about Events as a core feature of the DAO?
- seems overall like we've got a pretty strong "yes" on this one (from voices on the call)
  - so we should make an Events team to manage operations
  - and then we have to pull people to do those things
- if we're doing outward facing events - do we think it would make sense to have things be free and public?
  - personally i'd like to have internal things to get Events down as a skill
  - public: we add value to the brand by having things everyone would want to see
  - private: we add value internally to being a DevDAO member
  - Can take the example from TIME's NFT drop or the FWB party app for the private/semi-private content

we need to review the organization of the Discord server to make channel structure as usable as possible
  - hierarchy of channels may be as good as it gets
    - what can be done to maximize value, minimize number of redundant channels, etc
  - Mods have to point conversations to go to the right place if they're happening in unrelated channels (or over to Discourse as they make sense)
    - Discourse in particular will help reinforce the heirarchy of conversation (that is still notional) / self documenting DAO concept
      - Assume people will miss anything you say in Discord as it's going to scroll by

Event-ish but not quite events thoughts at the end
- do we want to do things like Buildspace coworking sessions?
- streamyard: `nader` recommends using as a way to have a platform with low effort; spread awareness of the stream via members / member platforms
  - perhaps have a weekly stream to have guests in that talk about things
- organize an initial event with ~8 talks for a streamyard event to make a big splash
  - put out a CFP for the meeting inside the DAO so that we are talking at our own event in addition to having outsiders

D_D should boost up member content via share-your-content
- combined presence of DAO members can make a big difference in getting content promoted by algorithm, etc
